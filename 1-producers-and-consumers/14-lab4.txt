1. Open a terminal window, cd /class and launch 11-python-kafka-avro-producer.py
2. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 12-python-kafka-avro-consumer.py
3. Check out how the AVRO message is being encoded and decoded in the source code for each.
4. Stop the consumer and look at 13-python-kafka-avro-consumer-deserializer.py
   Notice it's the same logic, except we pass the deserializers into Consumer initializer instead
   of calling them after the message is retrieved.
5. Stop the consumer and restart it with the -s switch which will redirect the output to append it to after
   MySQL table
6. Open another terminal and launch mysql.
7. use stocks;
8. select count(*) from trades;
9. run that several times to see that the messages are being added.
