1. Open a terminal window, cd /class and launch 4-python-kafka-json-producer-partition.py
2. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 5-python-kafka-json-consumer-partition.py -p 0
3. Notice how you only get messages from one or two of the stocks, the other is going to partition 1
4. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 5-python-kafka-json-consumer-partition.py -p 1
5. Now you should see messages going to each partition and each has it's own offsets.
6. Stop the producer.
7. Edit the 4-python-kafka-json-producer-partition.py to uncomment the two lines that assign a partition
   when it sends the message, rather than letting the key determine it.
7. You should see a difference in which partition the messages go to.
