1. Run the following to create a new topic with two partitions:
   kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic stocks-json2
   kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --topic stocks-json2 --partitions 2
2. Open a terminal window, cd /class and launch 4-python-kafka-json-producer-partition.py
3. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 5-python-kafka-json-consumer-partition.py -p 0
4. Notice how you only get messages from one or two of the stocks, the other is going to partition 1
5. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 5-python-kafka-json-consumer-partition.py -p 1
6. Now you should see messages going to each partition and each has it's own offsets.
7. Stop the producer.
8. Edit the 4-python-kafka-json-producer-partition.py to uncomment the two lines that assign a partition
   when it sends the message, rather than letting the key determine it.
9. You should see a difference in which partition the messages go to.
