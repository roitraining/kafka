1. Open a terminal window, cd /class and launch 1-python-kafka-json-producer.py
2. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 7-python-kafka-json-consumer-group.py -g group1
3. Open another terminal window, cd /class and launch 7-python-kafka-json-consumer-group.py -g group2
4. Notice how both windows get the same messages because they are different consumer groups.
5. Stop the second consumer group and relaunch it for group1.
6. Notice how the messages only go to one consumer window now, because they are the same consumer group 
   and partition.
7. Stop one of the processes, wait a few seconds and you should see the other consumer eventually start to
   receive the messages approximately from the offset of where the other ended.
8. Stop all of the processes.
9. Start 4-python-kafka-json-producer-partition.py
10. In each window start with the same group but different partitions and on the topics stocks-json2:
    7-python-kafka-json-consumer-group.py -g group1 -t stocks-json2 -p 0 
    7-python-kafka-json-consumer-group.py -g group1 -t stocks-json2 -p 1  
11. Notice how the two processes get only messages from one partition or the other. Without the second
    consumer for the same group, those messages would not be read.
